What factors should I consider when choosing a nursing facility?</strong>&nbsp;</span></a><br /> <br /> Certainly, you will want to look at cleanliness, gauge the warmth of the environment, and assess building comfort. But, there are other important intangibles to consider. You should look carefully at the leadership of the facility. Are they people to whom you would entrust the care of your loved one? Try to evaluate the staff. Feel free to speak with nurses and other staff members directly. Ask them how long have they been working there and what types of experience they have. Usually, a staff with longevity indicates a commitment to the residents. Ask to sample one of the meals. Would you want to eat the food? Of course, if a home will not make a meal available for you, that might be a warning sign! Use your eyes, your ears, and your own voice when visiting a facility.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <a id="#1" name="#1"><span style="color:#000000"><strong>Q. How will I know when I or someone I love requires nursing care?</strong>&nbsp;</span></a><br /> <br /> We find that many of our residents wish they had actually come to stay with us sooner. Whether for assistance in bathing and dressing, administration of daily medications, help with personal hygiene or even simple issues of continence, a skilled nursing home can be the answer to a senior&#39;s residential and health care needs. Isolated, lonely individuals also appreciate the socialization and activities that nursing facilities offer.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <a id="#2" name="#2"><span style="color:#000000"><strong>Q. Who pays for skilled nursing care?</strong></span></a>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> This is always an important question. There are three main sources of payment. Medicare, the federally funded program pays for up to 100 days of skilled nursing care (with a 20% copay after 20 days), and eligibility is based strictly on medical need. The criteria for Medicare eligibility are specific and rigorous. We find that typically, a new resident receives anywhere from 14 to 50 days of Medicare eligibility. At BaneCare Residences, we always try to maximize the Medicare benefit for our residents.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> After Medicare eligibility has been utilized, the next payment source is either private pay or Medicaid. Essentially, a resident will pay privately unless they have qualified for Medicaid. Medicaid is a state-funded program, which can be used if a resident has exhausted his or her resources. In effect, Medicaid is the payer of last resort. In addition, some of our residents use their long-term care insurance benefits to pay for their care.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Each resident&#39;s situation is different and can be very complicated. Our admission counselors are well versed in assisting our residents and their families in the intricacies of payment.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <a id="#3" name="#3"><span style="color:#000000"><strong>Q. How do residents spend their days?</strong>&nbsp;</span></a><br /> <br /> Depending on their abilities, residents can participate in a wide range of therapeutic activities. For those residents who are unable to participate in group activities, we take special care to provide one-on-one activity programming to meet each of our guest&#39;s individual needs.<a href="http://www.banecare.com/zyban-mit-70">.</a></p>
