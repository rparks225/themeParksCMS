We couldn&rsquo;t believe the turn-a-round she made after arriving at Rosewood and we&rsquo;re convinced it was due to the fact that she was surrounded by such wonderful and caring people like you! She thanked us several times for bringing her to such a beautiful place!

I can’t even count how many times over the past years I have assisted families in the difficult decision to place a parent into long term care, but when it was my turn to be in that position, I fully realized how hard the process can be for the family. Every step of the way your staff not only lived up to, but exceeded, the expectations and needs of my family. Their guidance, compassion, and support was outstanding. My mother was not only expertly cared for, but she truly had a family of caregivers and support staff that we knew would take care of her when we were no longer able to, and I took such great comfort in knowing that. Fred found the perfect roommate for her, and for the first time in many years, she had a friend. And, in the end, every staff member of Rosewood that interacted with my mother and with each member of my family, did so with such incredible kindness, compassion and sincere concern. They shared in our grief, fed us, hugged us when we needed a hug, cried with us at times, and celebrated her life with us when we needed to smile (especially at her love of wrestling and her long fingernails that she always like to have painted with red polish!). Please extend my thanks to your wonderful staff. Lori Cannon.</p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="2" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">Jean Raucci</strong><br /> To the staff at Rosewood, On behalf of my mother, Jean Raucci, she asked me to send this note of thanks to each and every one involved in her care while at your facility. She is grateful and asks forgiveness for not remembering all the names of those who were caring, compassionate, and instrumental in her speedy recovery. She would highly recommend your facility to anyone needing rehabilitation services. Our family was grateful we chose Rosewood for her care. She continues to make incredible progress. Thanks again to all of you, Jean Raucci. </p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="3" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">Beverly Richman</strong><br /> Dear Staff, My children and I would like to thank you all for the care and concern you showed to Boris during his stay with you. We couldn’t have asked for more love shown to him. All of you from the office, cleaners, kitchen, aides and nurses showed such compassion. We thank you all for making things easier for him and for us. Much love and gratitude, Beverly Richman. </p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="4" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">Joan M. Sherwood</strong><br /> I would like to thank the entire staff of Rosewood. I was there for 10/21/10 until 11/11/10 after I had total knee replacement. Every staff member I saw made me feel good to be there and made me feel relaxed and able to concentrate on getting better. I know if I didn’t go to rehab I would not have gotten as far as I was when I left there. Everyone was friendly and caring. I would recommend your rehab to anyone who would need it because I was treated so well there and they made me do what I had to do the first day and they pushed me so I could go home feeling I could do anything I put my mind to. Thank you again, Joan M. Sherwood. </p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="5" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">The Elder Family</strong><br /> As the family of Ernie Arnold & Martha Gray, we want to just send you a note on how much we as a family appreciated everything that you have done for us. Because of you all and your care for our loved ones, we were able to enjoy them a lot longer then if they were in their own home. We tribute their extension of live solely to all of you. We cannot thank you enough for everything that you all have done for both them and us. You should know that we all speak very highly of everyone working at Rosewood. Words can not express how much we thank you all for everything you have done for us. Thank you! With much Appreciation and Thanks, The Elder Family. </p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="6" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">Maureen McCarthy</strong><br /> I am writing today to once again let you know that my family and I have been very pleased with the care our mother, Dorothy McCarthy, has received at Rosewood. As difficult as it is for us not to have Mom at home with us, we believe Rosewood has been a very good placement for her. She, too, has had many positive things to say about Rosewood – she has appreciated that Mr. Dave Fossa has always responded positively to her dietary requests, and that so many of the nurses and CNAs have not only been professional in their work with her, but also respectful of and pleasant to her in the process. In particular, we would like to commend Mr. Fred Stone, nurse manager on the first floor, for his efforts every day, but most especially for his proactive response when it recently became evident that Mom required a change of rooms because of a new roommate who was extremely incompatible with her. Fred came to us before we could even get to him about this situation. He rectified it quickly and we are grateful. We understand that requesting a room change can be a headache, but Fred was very gracious in his handling of it. Thank you for reading – and for all you do for Rosewood. Maureen McCarthy. </p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="7" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">John Garrison</strong><br /> Following a recent total hip replacement at the Lahey Medical Center, I was admitted to the Rosewood rehabilitation program on October 1 and discharged October 10. I’m writing to compliment you and your staff on the high quality of rehab services and personal care that I received. Professionals, paraprofessionals, and support staff all performed at a very high level and certainly facilitated my recovery. And I would like to single out for special mention three members of the overnight nursing team – Max, Bill, and their female associate whose name I unfortunately have forgotten – all who showed me particular compassion and caring during several distressing early mornings when I needed assistance. Also, the setting of Rosewood as well as the inside physical environment where very pleasant, clean, and conducive to healing. The housekeeping staff was, without exception, kind and polite. And that wonderful view of the fall foliage from the window of my room made me feel like I was outside. I would recommend Rosewood to anyone seeking superior rehab services in a very pleasant environment. Keep up the good work. John Garrison. </p> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="8" style="display:none;"> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style="line-height:23px;padding:15px 0;"><strong class="fancy">Nancy C.</strong><br /> To my friends at Devereux, Many, many thanks for your fantastic care, thoughtfulness, and professionalism in all areas of my stay with you. Each and every person involved in my care was very special and I am so grateful. Over many years I’ve been in and out of hospitals and nursing homes and Devereux wins by a landslide for care and attention. Plus you have the very best therapy environment – the best I’ve ever seen! I’m home and doing well but I miss each and every one of you.

We know it wasn’t easy at times. You were all so caring, helpful and friendly. We felt like you were part of the family. You all made a difficult time much easier for our mother and us. It was comforting to know that we could go home and she was in such good hands. Thank you all so much. The Carlon Family. </p> </div> </div>  </div> </div>
